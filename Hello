why did we use the min max:
if we are doing machine learning in other context for example looking for patterns
but here we will get data in future in that are not the same as the data we have now ,
and this because when want the reclustering with the same scaler ,
values are derived from another software that give values in certain range
so the min max , made much more sense , and we tried to scale the data in other models ,
and the skewniss kind is not bad , and it was just on the chroma_cens , we are aware the data
is skewed thats why we used min max ; 
and it means that all the data are the same and our data doesnt cover all the possiblities ,
so we chose the minmax instead of standard scaler , because we are preparing this model to be able to work with future data , so we are anticpating for antoher kind of data that would have diverse values on chroma _ cens or that skewing we were facing  .






clustering is good and interesting , the way it recommend stuff , and its not classification only ,
and you need lables , its beyond that , 


its speicail because we are recommending base on the song it self , and not about anything else,
we tried many models hierical clustering and dbscan but we had no good results .

why kmeans ; we used kmeans because it is the best model that converge well , and it gave clusters that are well distrubuted , and the songs in the same cluster are actually the same in one way or another , this means that the problem we are trying to solve is not complicated and easy (mathmaticaly and statsitcally easy ) , and going for complex models was not benifcial(over engineering ).



cos(sine similarity )  xyzkasdf for each point
than we measure the distance for these points
and take the best distances
